# Requirements
AXII is a Kubernetes-native application, designed to run in a Kubernetes cluster and utilize its best features. To ensure smooth deployment and operation of AXII, certain requirements must be met.

## Kubernetes Cluster

A Kubernetes cluster is required to install and use the AXII application. In the default (system) cluster, AXII consumes a small amount of resources (approximately 0.5 CPU core and 4GB memory). These numbers grow very slowly with the number of users and data. The system cluster can also be shared with user's workloads, providing efficient resource allocation.

The cluster can be hosted in public Clouds or on-premise, depending on your organization's preferences and requirements. Setting up a Kubernetes cluster in most Cloud providers is simple and usually takes just a few minutes.

Our team is available to assist you in preparing and setting up an optimal environment for AXII, ensuring that you can take full advantage of the platform's capabilities.
