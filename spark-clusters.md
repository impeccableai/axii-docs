# Spark Clusters
Spark Clusters in AXII are a special type of compute Cluster designed specifically for running Spark Jobs. These Clusters provide an optimized environment for running large-scale data processing tasks using the Apache Spark framework.

## Spark on K8s Operator

AXII relies on the [Spark on K8s Operator](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator), a Kubernetes extension responsible for managing Spark Applications. The Spark on K8s Operator simplifies the deployment, configuration, and management of Spark jobs on Kubernetes, providing a seamless experience for running Spark workloads within AXII.

By leveraging the Spark on K8s Operator, AXII ensures that users can easily manage Spark Clusters, taking advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and fault-tolerance offered by the Apache Spark framework and Kubernetes platform.

With Spark Clusters and the Spark on K8s Operator integration, AXII provides users with a powerful and efficient environment for running large-scale data processing tasks, making it an ideal platform for AI and machine learning workloads.
