# AXII CLI: Command Line Access for Enhanced Automation
AXII recognizes the importance of providing a versatile and convenient way for AI experts to interact with the platform. In addition to the Web and API access, AXII offers a command line interface (CLI) that enables users to access and control the platform directly from their terminal or command prompt.

## CLI Use Cases: CI/CD Pipelines and Automation

The AXII CLI is particularly useful for integrating the platform into automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Users can leverage the CLI to perform tasks such as starting experiments, managing workflows, and monitoring progress, all through simple and intuitive commands.

By integrating AXII into their CI/CD pipelines, AI experts can ensure that their AI solutions are continuously tested, updated, and deployed in response to changes in code or data, leading to more reliable and robust AI systems.

## Accessing the AXII CLI: Docker Image

To make it easy for users to access and use the AXII CLI, a Docker image is provided, which can be found at `public.ecr.aws/impeccableai/axii-cli:<version>`. By utilizing this Docker image, users can quickly and easily set up the CLI in their development environment or CI/CD pipeline without having to worry about installation or compatibility issues.

To use the AXII CLI, simply pull the Docker image using the appropriate version tag and execute your desired commands within the container. This provides a seamless and hassle-free way to interact with the AXII platform using the command line.

## In Summary

The AXII CLI offers AI experts a convenient and powerful way to interact with the platform directly from their command line, enabling seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines and other automated processes. By leveraging the provided Docker image, users can easily access and utilize the CLI, streamlining their AI development workflows and enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of their AI solutions.
