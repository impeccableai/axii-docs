# Task Sizes
In AXII, users have the ability to specify the amount of compute resources needed during execution on a per-Node basis. This ensures that each Node has access to the necessary CPU, memory, and GPU resources required for efficient execution.

## Pre-configured Sizes

Administrators can pre-configure common \"sizes\" to simplify the process of selecting the appropriate size for Node execution. This allows users to choose from a list of pre-defined resource configurations, streamlining the process and ensuring consistent resource allocation across the organization.

## Configurable Values

The following values can be configured for each Task Size:

- **CPU cores**: The number of CPU cores allocated for the Node execution. This determines the processing power available for the workload.
- **Memory (RAM)**: The amount of memory (RAM) allocated for the Node execution. This determines the amount of data that can be stored and processed in memory during the execution.
- **GPUs**: The number of GPUs allocated for the Node execution. GPUs are especially useful for tasks that require significant parallel processing power, such as machine learning workloads.

By providing the ability to configure Task Sizes, AXII ensures that users can easily allocate the necessary compute resources for their workloads, resulting in more efficient execution and better overall performance.
