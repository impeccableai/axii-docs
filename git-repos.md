# Git Repos
AXII provides the ability to integrate with existing public and private Git repositories, streamlining the process of using source code in the platform. This integration makes it easy for users to leverage their existing repositories directly within AXII.

## One-Directional Integration

The integration between AXII and Git repositories is one-directional, meaning that AXII can only fetch data from a Git repo. This ensures that users can access their source code directly from the existing repository, without any risk of accidentally modifying the codebase through the AXII platform.

## Authentication Method

Currently, the only available authentication method for integrating Git repositories with AXII is through the use of SSH keys. This provides a secure and reliable method for accessing both public and private repositories, ensuring that sensitive code remains protected.

By integrating with Git repositories, AXII enables users to seamlessly incorporate their existing source code into the platform, simplifying the process of working with code and ensuring a consistent development experience.
