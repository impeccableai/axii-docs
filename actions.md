# Actions: Enhancing Interactions with AXII

In AXII, Action Nodes play a crucial role in providing users with a seamless and efficient way to interact with the platform directly. These specialized nodes enable users to perform specific tasks within their workflows, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the AI development process.

## Types of Action Nodes

AXII currently supports two types of Action Nodes:

1. **Promote to Data Source action**: This action allows users to convert an Artifact into a Data Source. The key advantage of this transformation is that, unlike Artifacts, Data Sources can be added as nodes within a workflow. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios such as Recurring Experiments, where users need to process raw data to generate a clean dataset for further use in model development.

2. **Promote to Model action**

## Promote to Data Source Action: Use Case

Let's consider a use case where an AI expert is working on a Recurring Experiment that involves processing raw data daily to create a clean and usable dataset. They can utilize the Promote to Data Source action to convert the processed data Artifact into a Data Source, which can then be easily incorporated into the workflow as a node.

By doing so, the AI expert is able to streamline the data preprocessing step within their Recurring Experiment, ensuring that the clean dataset is readily available for model development and training. This ultimately leads to increased efficiency and effectiveness in the AI development process.

## In Conclusion

Action Nodes in AXII play a vital role in enhancing the user experience by providing direct interactions with the platform and enabling specific tasks to be performed within workflows. With the current support for Promote to Data Source action and the Promote to Model action, users can achieve greater control and flexibility in their AI development processes, leading to more efficient and successful outcomes
