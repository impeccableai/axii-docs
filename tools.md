# Tools
A Tool in AXII is a generic wrapper name for common applications (utilities) that are frequently used in the process of AI development. AXII simplifies the setup and management of these tools, ensuring smooth integration into AXII's ecosystem. Currently, AXII supports two types of tools:

## Jupyter Notebook

AXII allows users to quickly spin up an instance of Jupyter Notebook with just a few simple clicks. Users can easily attach DataSources and Artifacts present in AXII to the Notebook, providing a seamless experience for AI experts working on their projects.

## TensorBoard

AXII also enables users to effortlessly create and deploy an instance of TensorBoard. Users can connect TensorBoard to a running Node, for example, to monitor relevant metrics during the development and execution of AI workflows.

By providing easy access to tools like Jupyter Notebook and TensorBoard, AXII empowers AI experts to focus on their work while the platform takes care of the underlying infrastructure and resource management. This streamlined experience allows users to develop and deploy AI solutions more efficiently and effectively.
