# Recurring Experiments
The Recurring Experiments feature in AXII is specifically designed to streamline AI development processes by automating the execution of experiments and workflows. This powerful feature allows AI experts to concentrate on enhancing their models and algorithms, while AXII takes care of scheduling and running the experiments as needed.

## Scheduling Experiments with CRON Expressions

To provide maximum flexibility and customization, AXII uses CRON expressions to define the schedule for recurring experiments. CRON expressions are a proven and widely adopted method for specifying time-based schedules in a concise yet expressive manner.

Users can set up a CRON expression to define the frequency of their experiment's execution, such as every hour, daily, or even on specific days of the week. This gives users full control over when their experiments run, ensuring that their AI workflows are executed at the most appropriate times.

## Enhancing Flexibility with Macros

AXII's Recurring Experiments feature is further enhanced by the integration of Macros, which allow users to create dynamic and adaptable workflows. Macros provide a way to parameterize different aspects of the workflow, enabling it to adjust to changing requirements and data sources automatically.

Users can employ Macros in their workflows to perform various tasks, such as fetching and processing new data, training models based on the latest data, or even adjusting hyperparameters of the models. This level of adaptability is crucial for AI experts who need their solutions to be able to evolve with the ever-changing data and requirements.

## Use Case: Daily Data Processing and Model Training

Imagine a scenario where an AI expert needs to train a model daily using the latest available data. With AXII's Recurring Experiments feature, they can set up a CRON expression to run the experiment every day at a specific time. By incorporating Macros, the workflow can automatically fetch the new data, process it, and train the model without any manual intervention.

This automation not only saves time and effort but also ensures that the AI solution remains up-to-date and relevant, providing reliable and accurate results.

## In Summary

The Recurring Experiments feature in AXII is a powerful tool for automating AI workflows, offering AI experts a high level of flexibility, customization, and adaptability. By leveraging CRON expressions for scheduling and Macros for creating dynamic workflows, users can ensure their AI solutions remain efficient, reliable, and up-to-date, ultimately leading to increased productivity and better results.
