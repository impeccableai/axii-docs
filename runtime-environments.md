# Runtime Environments
Runtime environments in AXII provide a convenient way to manage and utilize Clusters and Stores during the execution of Experiments. They simplify how users access compute and storage resources, ensuring a seamless experience when working with data and running workloads.

## Node Execution

During Experiment execution, each Node is executed in a specified Runtime Environment. This ensures that the Node has access to the necessary compute and storage resources, and that workloads are distributed efficiently across the available infrastructure.

## Managing Runtime Environments

Administrators can define one or more Runtime Environments to provide users with easy access to the appropriate compute and storage resources. This also allows for better organization and management of Clusters and Stores within the AXII platform.

## Geographically Distributed Clusters

A typical system configuration may include one runtime environment for each of the geographically distributed clusters. This ensures that workloads can be run efficiently across multiple locations, making it easier for organizations with distributed teams or data to work together effectively.

By providing a structured way to manage and utilize Clusters and Stores, Runtime Environments in AXII help users focus on their work, while the platform takes care of the underlying infrastructure management.
