# Users and Roles
In AXII, users can be assigned one of two roles, each with different levels of access and privileges within the system. This ensures that users have the appropriate permissions for their specific responsibilities and tasks.

## Roles

The two roles available in AXII are:

### Standard

The Standard role is appropriate for most users in the system. This role provides access to the core features of AXII, allowing users to create, manage, and execute Workflows, Nodes, and other components within the platform. Standard users can also access and manage their own Config Sets, Environment variables, and Secrets.

### Administrator

The Administrator role provides users with almost unlimited power and access within the AXII platform. In addition to the capabilities of the Standard role, Administrators can access the System Config section, where they can manage global settings, configure integrations with external services, and define Runtime Environments, Task Sizes, and more.

By providing different roles, AXII ensures that users have the appropriate level of access and control within the system, allowing for efficient collaboration and management of the platform.
