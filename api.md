# AXII API
AXII understands the diverse needs of AI experts and offers a flexible and powerful API to cater to those requirements. With API access, users can seamlessly integrate AXII into their existing development environments and automate various tasks, further enhancing their productivity and the capabilities of the platform.

## API Technology: Protobuf and gRPC

The AXII API is built on the Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) data format and the gRPC framework, which together provide a robust, efficient, and language-agnostic foundation for API communication. This technology choice allows users to interact with the API using most popular programming languages, ensuring that AI experts can leverage the API in their preferred development environments.

The API definitions can be found in AXII's public repository at [https://github.com/impeccableai/proto](https://github.com/impeccableai/proto). These definitions provide a clear and structured interface for interacting with the platform, enabling users to build custom integrations and automate tasks with ease.

## API Use Cases: Experiment Automation and Dynamic Workflows

The AXII API can be used for a variety of purposes, such as programmatically starting experiments or building dynamic workflows. By integrating the API into their development processes, users can automate repetitive tasks, streamline their workflows, and even create custom tools tailored to their specific needs.

For example, an AI expert might use the API to build a script that automatically starts a new experiment whenever a specific trigger occurs, such as the availability of new data or a change in an underlying model. This level of automation can lead to significant time savings and improved efficiency in the AI development process.

Another use case might involve building a dynamic workflow that adapts to changing requirements or data sources. By leveraging the API, users can create custom logic that modifies the workflow's structure or parameters in response to external events or conditions. This level of adaptability ensures that the AI solution remains up-to-date and relevant, providing reliable and accurate results.

## In Summary

The AXII API, powered by Protobuf and gRPC, offers AI experts a flexible and powerful way to integrate the platform into their existing development environments and automate various tasks. With its language-agnostic design and support for popular programming languages, the API enables users to create custom integrations, automate experiments, and build dynamic workflows that adapt to their specific needs. This ultimately leads to increased productivity, efficiency, and success in the AI development process.
